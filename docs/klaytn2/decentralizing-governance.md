## 비전통적 주체들의 성장에 대응<a id="response-to-non-traditional-entities"></a>
With technological advancement, we will live in a more metaversified world where the influence of non-traditional entities such as builders contributing to the operation of the metaverse and DAOs as a major form of organization in the metaverse will continue to grow.

## Diversification of Governance Participants <a id="diversification-of-governance-participants"></a>
In addition to traditional enterprises, by bringing the two decentralized entities into Klaytn Governance Council (GC), we are opening up the potential to rebuild the entire Klaytn governance structure in an unprecedented way with hundreds of governance participants.

## Voting Power that Scales with Community Support <a id="voting-power-that-scales-with-community-support"></a>
A stake-based governance model will be introduced to enable governance participants who can gather more support from Klaytn Communities to shape Klaytn in line with their preference. The Gini Coefficient will be discontinued soon. 메타버스화된 세상에서 적절한 결정을 내릴 수 있는 주체들이 클레이튼 GC에서 더 많은 영향력을 지니게 될 것입니다. 우리는 DAO와 빌더들이 해당 영역의 리더가 될 것이라 믿습니다.

## Ultimate Goal of Decentralization <a id="ultimate-goal-of-decentralization"></a>
When the level of metaversification crosses the critical threshold, Klaytn governance will be fully decentralized with DAOs and builders. Ultimately, Klaytn will evolve into a DAO of DAOs and a platform for DAOs to communicate the voices of Klaytn Communities through on-chain mechanisms.
