## 개요 <a id="overview"></a>

### Klaytn 거버넌스 카운슬: Klaytn 기여자와 함께 거버넌스를 운영 <a id="klaytn-governance-council-co-governed-by-klaytn-contributors"></a>

Klaytn의 장기적인 발전과 이해관계를 공유하며 플랫폼을 수립하고 확장하는 기여자들이야말로 Klaytn 거버넌스 참여에 가장 적합한 주체라고 생각합니다. Klaytn에 새로운 서비스를 제공하여 블록체인 서비스 대중화를 지원하는 서비스 제공자, Klaytn을 세상에 소개하고 홍보하는 생태계 빌더 등 모든 형태의 기여자가 Klaytn 거버넌스 카운슬의 구성원이 될 수 있습니다. 즉, Klaytn 거버넌스 카운슬은 Klaytn의 장기적 성장을 이끄는 의사결정 그룹입니다.

### 부트스트래핑 <a id="bootstrapping"></a>

초기 단계에서 신뢰할 수 있는 플랫폼을 만들기 위해, 오직 신뢰할 수 있는 주체들만 Klaytn 거버넌스 카운슬의 잠재적인 멤버로 간주됩니다. 개발 및 안정화 단계에서 프로토콜이 신속하게 개선될 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.

## 거버넌스 사항 <a id="governance-topics"></a>

거버넌스 구조를 통해 결정할 수 있는 주요 사항은 다음과 같은 3가지이며, 추가 의사결정이 필요한 제안은 정기 회의나 임시 회의에서 검토될 수 있습니다. Klaytn 거버넌스 카운슬은 Klaytn의 성장에 가장 적합한 결정을 내려야 합니다.

- **Technology**
  - Matters related to the technical update of the platform. Here the issues on the blockchain's basic structure (e.g., Account Structure), new features (e.g., L2 solution), or software update schedule are included.
- **Economy**
  - Issues relating to additional issuance of KLAY and its distribution structure, changes in transaction fees, and Klaytn Improvement Reserve spending approval etc. are included in this category.
- **Governing Rule**
  - The governance subjects and processes, as well as the rules for the responsibilities and rights of governing bodies, are included in this category.

## 거버넌스 프로세스 <a id="governance-process"></a>

Klaytn principally aims for the governance process to occur within the protocol (on-chain). Through this process, the votes will be recorded on the blockchain, and the results will be carried out following the vote. As the platform grows, more matters will be handled through on-chain governance.

### 일반 거버넌스 프로세스 <a id="general-governance-process"></a>

The initial governance process proceeds in the following order: proposal introduction, statement of opinion submitted by advisors, voting by council members, and various follow-up procedures depending on the result of the vote.

Those who have the right to introduce proposals can make sure each proposal is voted on by introducing it. Once the proposal is introduced, the advisors must conduct expert analysis on the proposal and submit a statement of opinion with their results.

During the initial phase of Klaytn governance, the Klaytn Governance Council members will have the right to vote on the introduced proposals and will reference the advisors' statements of opinion to vote on what they believe to be the best option. If the number of votes passes the threshold, the proposal will pass; if not, the proposal will be dismissed. In its initial phase, the voting process may be replaced by a discussion process facilitated by the Klaytn foundation. The follow-up measures for an approved proposal will be led by the chairman, and the chairman has the responsibility to carry out all the proposals that have been passed by the council during his or her term.

### Klaytn 개선 준비금 심사 절차(Klaytn Improvement Reserve Review Process)<a id="klaytn-improvement-reserve-review-process"></a>


The KIR Proposal review will be decided through the voting of the Governance Council members, and the proposal will be rejected if half of the committee or more vote against(rejected) the proposal. For more details on the KIR Proposal review, refer to the following.

## Governance Roadmap <a id="governance-roadmap"></a>

The bodies participating in governance must act in consideration of Klaytn’s long-term benefits rather than just for their personal interests, and they must actively participate in the governance process. Additionally, all participants that contribute to the network as Klaytn Governance Council members must secure computing resources that are greater than the platform requirements and stake a set amount KLAY of their own or from third parties. For smooth operations in development and stabilization of the platform, Klaytn Foundation will take on many roles in governance related matters in the initial development phase. In the future, however, other bodies will gradually take on greater roles in the decision-making process, and they will have the right to participate independently.

* **Development Phase**: The initial development phase after the mainnet launch must quickly see parameter adjustments, new feature developments, etc. For this to be possible, many issues will be decided through gathering the opinions of the Klaytn Governance Council members, service providers, and community members. To secure initial stabilization, Klaytn Foundation will lead the decision-making process. Additionally, all decided matters will be transparently shared with the public.
* **Stabilization Phase**: The Klaytn Governance Council has governing rights on many proposals and this phase will gradually begin starting Jan 2021. For special matters such as those concerning platform development, and matters that directly affect the overall Klaytn ecosystem, Klaytn foundation may facilitate the discussion and execution.
* **Decentralization Phase**: Following the stabilization period, to gather additional opinions, more service providers and other bodies may be brought into the decision-making process. Decentralization phase may be gradually achieved through multiple stages with different governing rules and participants.
